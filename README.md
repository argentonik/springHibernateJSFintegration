# A Java Web Application 

Before use this project, set the username and password of the database in the __applicationContext.xml__ file. The file is in src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/ folder.

This project uses Maven to manage the dependencies, build the source code and package the application. For all that, open a terminal in the project folder and execute the following command:

```shell
mvn clean package
```

The tomcat is used as the application server. To run the server, open a terminal in the project folder and execute: 

sh target/bin/webapp

Thanks!
